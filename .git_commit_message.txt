fix: correct alchemy buff implementation

Corrects the buff application logic in the `AlchemyCrafting` class to align with the established pattern in the `ForgingCrafting` class.

The previous implementation incorrectly checked for buff IDs in a list within the state, which was never populated by the simulator. This fix changes the logic to check for a boolean flag directly on the state object, which is the correct behavior.
