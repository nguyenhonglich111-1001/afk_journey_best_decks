feat: Update card effects for Forge and Slow Cook

This commit updates the effects of two cards based on recent upgrades.

- The 'Forge' card's bonus has been increased from +3 to +5.
- The 'Slow Cook' card's effect has been changed from a conditional buff to a direct '+2' to all colors.

The changes are reflected in both the card logic implementation and the descriptions in `cards.json`.
