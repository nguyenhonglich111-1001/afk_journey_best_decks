feat(alchemy): Implement "Fuse" card

This commit introduces the new "Fuse" card to the Alchemy crafting type.

The "Fuse" card has a unique mechanic where it triggers at the end of the production cycle, granting a bonus if the two color scores are close to each other.

- Adds the "Fuse" card definition to `data/cards.json`.
- Implements the core end-of-cycle logic in the `CardSimulator` by checking for the "Fuse" card after all other cards have been played.
- Adds a placeholder function in `src/crafting/alchemy.py` to maintain architectural consistency.
