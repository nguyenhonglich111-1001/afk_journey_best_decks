feat: Add consistency simulation mode

This commit introduces a new simulation mode to evaluate decks based on their consistency in reaching a specific target score.

- A `--target-score` command-line argument has been added to `main.py`.
- When this argument is used, the simulator calculates the percentage of runs that meet or exceed the target, sorting decks by this "consistency" metric.
- The `CardSimulator` and its helper functions in `simulator.py` have been updated to handle both the average score and the new consistency calculation.
- The output in `main.py` has been adjusted to clearly display the results for either mode, ensuring the user knows whether they are viewing decks sorted by highest score or highest consistency.
