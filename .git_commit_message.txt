refactor(alchemy): Centralize pre-card effects

This commit refactors the `AlchemyCrafting` class to centralize the application of pre-card effects, improving maintainability and adhering to the DRY principle.

Previously, the `_apply_enchant_debuff`, `_apply_warmdust_deck_buff`, and `_apply_calming_warmdust_deck_buff` methods were redundantly called at the beginning of each individual card function (`ingredient`, `grind`, `enchant`, `distill`).

Changes include:
- Added a new `apply_pre_card_effects` hook to the `BaseCrafting` class, providing a generic point for pre-card logic.
- Overrode this hook in `AlchemyCrafting` to consolidate the specific pre-card effect calls.
- Updated the `CardSimulator` to call this new `apply_pre_card_effects` hook before executing each card's main function.
- Removed the redundant pre-card effect calls from the individual card methods in `AlchemyCrafting`.

This refactoring streamlines the card logic, making it easier to add or modify pre-card effects in the future without repetitive code changes.
