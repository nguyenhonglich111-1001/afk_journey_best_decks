feat(reports): Implement grouped and filtered batch reports

This commit introduces a major enhancement to the reporting capabilities of the simulator, allowing for more organized and targeted analysis.

Key changes:
- Added a `--crafting_type` filter to the `--item all` batch mode, enabling users to run simulations for a specific crafting category.
- Implemented result grouping by `crafting_type` in batch mode, providing a more structured and readable report.
- Updated the Discord-friendly output formatter to display the new grouped format, with clear headers for each crafting type.
- Unified the single-item analysis to use the same grouped report format, ensuring a consistent user experience across all analysis modes.
- Replaced unicode emoji with text-based markers for better compatibility with different terminals.
