chore: Project health check and state verification

This commit encompasses a full health check of the project after a significant branch merge. It verifies, corrects, and documents the simulation's state management and card logic.

Key changes include:
- Conducted a manual, step-by-step execution of all application modes (general, single-item, and batch) to ensure stability.
- Fixed a critical syntax error in `crafting/kitchen.py` that prevented the app from running.
- Corrected the simulation's initial state in `simulator.py`, removing an unused variable and restoring a mistakenly deleted one.
- Added `requirements.txt` to formalize project dependencies.
- Created detailed analysis and documentation plans for the post-merge health check and the complete card/item logic.
