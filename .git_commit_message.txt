fix: Correct Slow Cook card mechanic

This commit corrects the implementation of the 'Slow Cook' card based on user feedback.

The previous implementation was incorrect. The updated logic is as follows:
- 'Slow Cook' now provides a stacking bonus to 'Heat Control'.
- Each 'Heat Control' flip now adds the accumulated 'Slow Cook' bonus to both colors, in addition to its base effect.

The changes are reflected in the card logic, the simulator's initial state, and the card's description in `cards.json`.
