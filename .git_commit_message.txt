feat: Remove consistency simulation mode

This commit removes the `--target-score` command-line argument and all associated logic for the "consistency" simulation mode.

The key changes include:
- Deleting the `--target-score` argument from `main.py`.
- Removing the `target_score` attribute and related calculations from `simulator.py`.
- Simplifying the `evaluate_deck` and `find_best_decks` methods in `simulator.py` to only handle average score calculation and sorting.
- Cleaning up the result printing logic in `main.py` to remove conditional formatting for the consistency mode.

The application's default and only behavior (outside of special item modes) is now to find the decks with the highest average score.
