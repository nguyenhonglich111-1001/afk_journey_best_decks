feat: Add alchemy crafting type and new item

This commit introduces the new "alchemy" crafting type to the simulator.

- Adds four new alchemy cards: Ingredient, Grind, Enchant, and Distill.
- Implements new game mechanics for highest/lowest color targeting and a future-card debuff (`Enchant`).
- Corrects the `Enchant` card logic to ensure it is affected by previously played debuffs, based on user-provided scenarios.
- Adds the "Growth Serum" item for the alchemy crafting type.
- Registers the new type and its components within the core application.
