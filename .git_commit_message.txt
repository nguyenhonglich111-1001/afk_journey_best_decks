feat: Implement Fireproof Helm buff for Forging crafting

Adds the 'fireproof_helm_buff' to the Forging crafting type.
- The first three 'Forge' cards played while this buff is active will
  affect both yellow and blue colors, regardless of other conditions.
- Tracks the number of 'Forge' cards played with a new state variable
  'fireproof_helm_forge_count'.
