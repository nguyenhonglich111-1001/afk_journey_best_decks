feat: Add star-optimized deck analysis mode

This commit introduces a new analysis mode for finding decks that are optimized to achieve the highest possible star-rating for a specific item.

- The simulator can now accept a list of `star_thresholds` from `items.json`.
- When these thresholds are present for an item, the simulation calculates the probability of reaching each star level (1-star, 2-star, 3-star, etc.).
- A new sorting logic has been implemented to rank decks by the highest achievable star, using average score as a tie-breaker.
- The command-line output has been updated to display a detailed breakdown of star-level probabilities for the top decks.
- This new mode is triggered automatically when running an analysis for an item that contains the `star_thresholds` attribute, while maintaining full backward compatibility with the default (highest score) and consistency (`--target-score`) modes.
