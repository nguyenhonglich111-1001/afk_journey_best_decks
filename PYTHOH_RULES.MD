## Core Principles & Guides

1.  **PEP 8: The Python Style Guide**
    This is the foundational document for Python code style. It covers:
    * **Indentation:** Always 4 spaces, never tabs (or mix of both).
    * **Line Length:** Max 79 characters for code, 72 for docstrings and comments. While some projects allow longer, sticking to 79 generally improves readability, especially when viewing code side-by-side.
    * **Blank Lines:**
        * Two blank lines between top-level function and class definitions.
        * One blank line between method definitions inside a class.
        * Use blank lines sparingly within functions to indicate logical sections.
    * **Naming Conventions:**
        * **`snake_case`** for functions, variables, and modules.
        * **`CapWords` (CamelCase)** for class names.
        * **`UPPER_CASE_SNAKE_CASE`** for constants.
        * Avoid single-character names (except for simple loop iterators like `i` or `j`).
        * Use descriptive, meaningful names.
    * **Whitespace:**
        * Spaces around binary operators (`=`, `+`, `==`, etc.).
        * No spaces immediately inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.
        * No trailing whitespace.
    * **Imports:**
        * Always at the top of the file, after module docstrings and comments.
        * Grouped in the following order:
            1.  Standard library imports
            2.  Related third-party imports
            3.  Local application/library specific imports
        * Each import on a separate line.
        * Avoid wildcard imports (`from module import *`).
    * **Comments:**
        * Use sparingly; clear code is often self-documenting.
        * Explain *why* the code does something, not *what* it does (unless the "what" is complex).
        * Update comments as code evolves.
        * Block comments: Indented to the same level as the code they describe, starting with `#` and a single space.
        * Inline comments: On the same line as the statement, separated by two or more spaces, starting with `#` and a single space.

2.  **The Zen of Python (`import this`)**
    This set of guiding principles emphasizes:
    * **Beautiful is better than ugly.**
    * **Explicit is better than implicit.**
    * **Simple is better than complex.**
    * **Readability counts.**
    * Errors should never pass silently (unless explicitly silenced).
    * There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.

## Advanced Pythonic & High-Quality Practices

Beyond PEP 8, a high standard of Python code embraces:

1.  **Readability and Clarity:**
    * **Meaningful Names:** Variables, functions, and classes should have names that clearly convey their purpose and intent.
    * **Docstrings (PEP 257):** Every module, class, and function/method should have a docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return values. NumPy-style or Google-style docstrings are common and recommended for structured documentation.
    * **Type Hinting (PEP 484):** Use type hints (`def func(arg: int) -> str:`) to improve code clarity, enable static analysis tools (like MyPy), and make your code easier to understand and maintain, especially in larger projects.
    * **`f-strings` for String Formatting:** Prefer f-strings for their conciseness and readability over older methods like `.format()` or `%`.
    * **List Comprehensions/Generator Expressions:** Use these for concise and efficient creation of lists, sets, and dictionaries, but only when they *improve* readability, not hinder it.
    * **Context Managers (`with` statement):** Use `with` statements for resource management (files, locks, network connections) to ensure resources are properly acquired and released, even if errors occur.
    * **Decorators:** Leverage decorators for adding functionality to functions or methods in a clean, reusable way (e.g., `@property`, `@classmethod`, custom decorators for logging, timing, etc.).

2.  **Modularity and Organization:**
    * **Break Down into Small, Reusable Functions:** Functions should ideally do one thing and do it well. Long, complex functions are hard to test and debug.
    * **Classes for Encapsulation:** Use classes to group related data and functionality, especially when dealing with complex entities or states.
    * **Package Structure:** Organize your project into logical modules and packages, making it easy to navigate and understand the codebase.
    * **Separation of Concerns:** Design your code so that different parts handle distinct responsibilities (e.g., UI logic separate from business logic, data access separate from processing).

3.  **Robustness and Error Handling:**
    * **Graceful Exception Handling:** Don't just `pass` on exceptions. Catch specific exceptions, log them, and provide informative error messages or fallback mechanisms. Use `try...except...else...finally` blocks appropriately.
    * **Validation:** Validate inputs to functions and methods early to prevent unexpected behavior and provide clear feedback on invalid data.

4.  **Testing:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests for your code. This ensures correctness, helps catch regressions, and serves as living documentation. Tools like `pytest` are standard.
    * **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Consider writing tests *before* writing the implementation. This forces clear thinking about requirements and API design.

5.  **Performance and Efficiency (where it matters):**
    * **Leverage Built-in Functions and Libraries:** Python's standard library and popular third-party libraries (like NumPy for numerical operations) are highly optimized. Use them instead of reinventing the wheel.
    * **Understand Data Structures:** Choose the right data structure (list, tuple, set, dictionary) for the task at hand based on their performance characteristics for common operations.
    * **Avoid Premature Optimization:** Only optimize code when profiling indicates a performance bottleneck. Focus on clarity and correctness first.

6.  **Tooling and Automation:**
    * **Linters (`Flake8`, `Pylint`):** Use linters to automatically check your code for PEP 8 compliance, potential errors, and stylistic issues.
    * **Auto-formatters (`Black`, `isort`):** Tools like `Black` automatically format your code according to a consistent style, taking the burden of manual formatting off your shoulders. `isort` sorts your imports.
    * **Static Analysis (`MyPy` for type checking):** Integrates with type hints to catch type-related errors before runtime.
    * **Version Control (`Git`):** Essential for collaboration, tracking changes, and managing different versions of your codebase.
    * **Virtual Environments (`venv`, `Poetry`, `PDM`, `uv`):** Isolate project dependencies to avoid conflicts between projects. Modern tools like Poetry or PDM also handle dependency management and packaging.
    * **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** Automate testing, linting, and deployment processes to ensure code quality and rapid delivery.
